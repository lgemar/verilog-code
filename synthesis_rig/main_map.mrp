  Number of Slice LUTs:                      2,270 out of  27,288    8%
    Number used as logic:                    2,263 out of  27,288    8%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,875
      Number using O5 output only:             149
      Number using O5 and O6:                  239
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      7
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         7
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       340 out of  13,644    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,301
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,892 out of   3,301   57%
    Number with an unused LUT:               1,031 out of   3,301   31%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         378 out of   3,301   11%
    Number of unique control sets:              62
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             149 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        65 out of     218   29%

    IOB Flip Flops:                              3
